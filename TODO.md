# Things To Do#

* fix table overflow (use "next" and "prev" navigators?)
* fix filters display (HRs and screen sizes)
* wire up nationality
* add more beers to the beer array
* table wrap for very small screens ??
* split pint glass image and add foam (maybe appropriate color?)
* maybe add appropriate glass styles for the beer results? (not really... how do you decide?)
